# Experiments using the tyescript compiler with jsdoc annotated javascript
VSCode uses tsc under the hood to give feedback about the types used in your code.

example 1 - Let tsc infer types without providing jsdoc comments.

example 2 - Use JSDoc comments to help tsc determine types.

example 3 - Use JSDoc and a tsconfig.json file
